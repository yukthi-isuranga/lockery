## By Yukthi Isuranga Bombuwala


ABC Technologies runs an operation for commuters to store their goods in a storage facility. ABC Technologies have launched an app to its users called “Lockery”. Lockery app has few features where you can scan QR codes, check for available locker locations, check for available storage rack and reserve it, make payments for the usage of lockers, and lock and unlock the lockers. 
ABC Technologies have identified a new method to automate the process of verifying and locking the storage racks. They want you to create a tablet application with the features/functionalities below.


## features/functionalities

1.	Generate unique QR Codes for Lockery users to scan 
2.	Post QR code scan Display the verified user information
3.	Lockery users should be able to unlock the empty storage rack by interacting with App
4.	Once the rack is closed and locked the app should indicate the rack lock status 
5.	Once the rack is locked, Lockey user should make the payment via Lockery app, Tab application should indicate the payment received or decline message
6.	Lockery users should receive notification in tablet app and mobile app with the rack number and start and end dates as a notification.
